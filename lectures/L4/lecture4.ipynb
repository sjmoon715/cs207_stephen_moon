When Sally made their original commit, they were given a commit hash (starting with 2658cab). When Joe resolved the merge conflict, Joe created a new commit hash (51c6b05) which unified the changes in commit 2658cab (Sally's original commit) and commit 3b934ee (Joe's original commit). Then, when Joe pushed, all of this information was given to the upstream repository. So `git` has a record stating that the merge resolution commit 51c6b05 is a subsequent commit to Sally's original changes in 2658cab. When Sally `fetch`ed the upstream repo, Sally got this information, too. So when Sally executed a `merge`, Sally was merging a predecessor (2658cab) with its direct successor (51c6b05), which `git` handles simply by using the successor.\n",

    "One of the big lessons here is that versioning binary files with `git` requires some special tools.  In this case, the binary file was a `.pdf` document.  In another case it may be an executable file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why binary files are difficult to version is because `git` must store the entire file again after each commit.  This is essentially a consequence of the fact that there is no clear way to `diff` binary files.  Hence, the `merg`ing operation has problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is extensive information around for the special tools `git` has for working with binary files.  For the particular case of `.pdf` files, you can use some special arguments to the `git checkout` command.  A nice discussion can be found at [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/278081/resolving-a-git-conflict-with-binary-files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/278081/resolving-a-git-conflict-with-binary-files).\n",
    "\n",
    "My recommendation is that you try to stay away from versioning binary files.  I put them up on `git` because I will not be changing the lectures slides much (if at all) over the course of the semester and because the lecture slides do not take up much space (and will therefore not have much of an effect on the speed of `git`)."

    "** * Commit early, commit often. * **\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is more effective when used at a fine granularity. For starters, you can't undo what you haven't committed, so committing lots of small changes makes it easier to find the right rollback point. Also, merging becomes a lot easier when you only have to deal with a handful of conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "** * Commit unrelated changes separately. * **\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying the source of a bug or understanding the reason why a particular piece of code exists is much easier when commits focus on related changes. Some of this has to do with simplifying commit messages and making it easier to look through logs, but it has other related benefits: commits are smaller and simpler, and merge conflicts are confined to only the commits which actually have conflicting code.\n",
    "\n",
    "** * Do not commit binaries and other temporary files. * **\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is meant for tracking changes. In nearly all cases, the only meaningful difference between the contents of two binaries is that they are different. If you change source files, compile, and commit the resulting binary, git sees an entirely different file. The end result is that the git repository (which contains a complete history, remember) begins to become bloated with the history of many dissimilar binaries. Worse, there's often little advantage to keeping those files in the history. An argument can be made for periodically snapshotting working binaries, but things like object files, compiled python files, and editor auto-saves are basically wasted space.\n",
    "\n",
    "** * Ignore files which should not be committed * **\n",
    "\n",
    "Git comes with a built-in mechanism for ignoring certain types of files. Placing filenames or wildcards in a `.gitignore` file placed in the top-level directory (where the `.git` directory is also located) will cause git to ignore those files when checking file status. This is a good way to ensure you don't commit the wrong files accidentally, and it also makes the output of `git status` somewhat cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "** * Always make a branch for new changes * **\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's tempting to work on new code directly in the `master` branch, it's usually a good idea to create a new one instead, especially for team-based projects. The major advantage to this practice is that it keeps logically disparate change sets separate. This means that if two people are working on improvements in two different branches, when they merge, the actual workflow is reflected in the git history. Plus, explicitly creating branches adds some semantic meaning to your branch structure. Moreover, there is very little difference in how you use git.\n",
    "\n",
    "** * Write good commit messages * **\n",
    "\n",
    "I cannot understate the importance of this.\n",
