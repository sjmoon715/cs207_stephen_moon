    "In the introduction, we motivated the need for computational techniques to compute derivatives.  The focus in the introduction was on the finite difference method, but we also computed a symbolic derivative.  The finite difference approach is nice because it is quick and easy.  However, it suffers from accuracy and stability problems.  On the other hand, symbolic derivatives can be evaluated to machine precision, but can be costly to evaluate.  We'll have more to say about cost of symbolic differentiation later."

    "Automatic differentiation (AD) overcomes both of these deficiencies.  It is less costly than symbolic differentiation while evaluating derivatives to machine precision.  There are two modes of automatic differentiation: forward and reverse.  This course will be primarily concerned with the forward mode.  Time-permitting, we will give an introduction to the reverse mode.  In fact, the famous backpropagation algorithm from machine learning is a special case of the reverse mode of automatic differentiation."

    "The \"dot\" notation is somewhat standard notation in the AD community (as much as any terminology is standard in the AD community).  You should feel free to use whatever notation makes you happy in this class.  Note, too, that when we start into the reverse mode, the intermediate steps are no longer denoted by a \"dot\".  In the reverse mode, intermediate steps are denoted with an \"overbar\".  This differing notation helps in distinguishing the two modes."

    "A dual number has a real part and a dual part.  We write $$z = a + \\epsilon b$$ and refer to $b$ as the dual part.  We *define* the number $\\epsilon$ so that $\\epsilon^{2} = 0$.  **This does not mean that $\\epsilon$ is zero!**  $\\epsilon$ is not a real number.\n",

    "#### Some properties of dual numbers:\n",
    "* Conjugate:  $z^{*} = a - \\epsilon b$.\n",
    "* Magnitude: $\\left|z\\right|^{2} = zz^{*} = \\left(a+\\epsilon b\\right)\\left(a-\\epsilon b\\right) = x^{2}$.\n",
