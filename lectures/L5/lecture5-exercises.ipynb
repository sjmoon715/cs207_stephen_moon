    "# Exercise 1:  Closures\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will write a closure to make writing messages easier.  Suppose you write the following message all the time: \n",
    "```python \n",
    "print(\"The correct answer is: {0:17.16f}\".format(answer))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Wouldn't it be nicer to just write \n",
    "```python \n",
    "correct_answer_is(answer)\n",
    "```\n",
    "and have the message?  Your task is to write a closure to accomplish that.  Here's how everything should work:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "correct_answer_is = my_message(message)\n",
    "correct_answer_is(answer)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output should be: `The correct answer is:  42.0000000000000000.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now change the message to something else.  Notice that you don't need to re-write everything.  You simply need to get a new message function from `my_message` and invoke your new function when you want to.\n",

    "# Exercise 2:  Decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will write a decorator to count how many times a function is accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a function that is used all the time and you wish to figure out how much it is called.  Note that this could go hand-in-hand with a code optimization to speed up performance.  You can have a timing decorator (see lecture and homework) and a counting decorator to help you figure out what the offending function is and how bad the situation is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints\n",
    "* The first thing to try would be to create a `counter` outside the inner function and then increment `counter` within the inner function.  But this will fail because of encapsulation (see lecture notes and homework 2).  One way to fix this is to use the `nonlocal` keyword like you will do in your homework.\n",
    "* Another way to solve this is to save the state of the inner function in a \"method attribute\".  We haven't discussed this idea yet in lecture, but it could go something like this:\n",
    "  1.) Set `inner_function.counter = 0` *after* declaring the inner function.  Remember, the decorator will run this as soon as it is called.\n",
    "  2.) Inside the inner function, simply increment the attribute as usual (e.g. `inner_function.counter += 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"Design\" choices\n",
    "* The inner function should print out how many times the function has been called.\n",
    "* You will have to demo your output.  This means that you will need to create a toy example to showcase how things work and that means you need to write a toy demo function. Write any function you like as long as it is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Demo output\n",
    "Here is a little demo.  Suppose I have a function called `distance()` that computes the Euclidean distance from the origin of various tuples.  In this example, the x- and y-coordinates are stored in separate lists and a tuple is comprised of an `x-y` pair.  Those details are only so you can understand the little example to follow.  It's okay if you don't perfectly follow the use-case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `distance()` function will be called multiple times (here demoed as a `for` loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xs = [1, 3, 5] # x-coordinates\n",
    "ys = [-5, -3, 1] # y-coordinates\n",
    "for x, y in zip(xs, ys):\n",
    "    d = distance(x, y) # distance has been decorated (not shown here)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output might be something like:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "distance has been used: 1x\n",
    "distance has been used: 2x\n",
    "distance has been used: 3x\n",
    "```\n",
